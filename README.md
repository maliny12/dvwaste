## About `dvwaste` Package

Plastic pollution is a global crisis rapidly spiralling out of control, leaving a detrimental mark on our environment, oceans, and future generations. While plastic is a versatile material that has transformed various industries, its disposal and mismanagement have resulted in dire consequences. The aim of this R package is to explore the global plastic pollution problem through a **Shiny App** and relevant functions, by examining how much each country produces, how much mismanaged waste is produced, and the urgent need for effective waste management systems, focusing on plastic emissions into the ocean.

## Installation

```
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2023/dvwaste-maliny12")
```

-   it has a shiny app, with the aims to make people more aware of the global plastic pollution problem, encourage discussions about the issue, and provide insights into which countries contribute the most to this environmental challenge. Users can interact with the app to explore the data and gain a better understanding of the magnitude of plastic waste generation and mismanagement around the world.

-   the package contains 3 datasets that are related to plastic waste and provide information on different aspects of plastic waste generation, mismanagement, and its relationship with GDP per capita for various countries.
